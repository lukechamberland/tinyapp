# Luke's TinyApp Project

This project was completed as part of week 6-7 of the Web development bootcamp at lighthouse labs.  The main ideas of this app is to get comfortable using node, as well as express.js.  As for the app itself, it allows a simple way for users to shorten long url's into shorter ones.  The app also allows users to register and login, ensuring a safe protection of your password.  It essentially runs the same way any other web application runs, in the sense of register and login/logout.  

## My experience

Overall this project was a challenge for me, but having completed it I've gained a large amount of knowledge as to express and overall backend development.  The use of the get/post requests and the introduction to html/ejs fundamentals, allowed me to gain insight on tasks that I am likely to encounter in the workplace, and I especially enjoyed the use of cookies in this assignment, as well as learning about what they are, how they work and how the play a major role in this application, and most other web applications I am firmiliar with.  

## Final Product

The 'main' page of the app.  This is where users will start, regardless of registration/login.

The register page of the app. This is where users will sign up or create an account, which they can then log in to later on.

The page users will see when the app asks for what page they would like a shortened url.

The page users will receive after the url is generated.  This will display a link to the requested webpage, that is in the form of a shortened url.
