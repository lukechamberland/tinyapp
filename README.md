# Luke's TinyApp Project

This project was completed as part of week 6-7 of the Web development bootcamp at lighthouse labs.  The main ideas of this app is to get comfortable using node, as well as express.js.  As for the app itself, it allows users to shorten long url's into shorter ones.  The app also allows users to register and login, ensuring a safe protection of your password.  It essentially runs the same way any other web application runs, in the sense of register, and login/logout.  

## My expirience

Overall this project was a challenge for me, but having completed it I've gained a large amount of knowledge as to express and overall backend development.  The use of the get/post requests and the introduction to html/ejs fundamentals, allowed me to gain insight on tasks that I am likely to encounter in the workplace, and I especially enjoyed the use of cookies in this assignment, as well as learning about what they are, how they work and how the play a major role in this application, and most other web applications I am firmiliar with.
